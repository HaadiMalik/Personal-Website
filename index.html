            <p> Hello, my name is Haadi Malik. I graduated in August of 2024 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from The College of New Jersey (TCNJ). I graduated
                am now searching for a job in the industry while also keeping an open-mind about enrolling in a master's degree. Before deciding to develop this website, I was
                finishing college while also learning skills on my own through various websites and online courses. After a while, I realized that learning all these skills
                would be greatly helpful, but I needed to do more than "theoretical learning." To that end, I started attempting more practical projects, courses, problems, and
                hands-on experience. </p>
            <p> I am passionate about doing something I know will make a difference. That's what I enjoy. By that, I mean that being given a task or a project, I am willing to do it.
                But my true motivation comes from knowing that what I'm doing matters: that what I'm doing has purpose.   </p>

        <h2 class="section-title"> Projects </h2>

        <h4 class="project-title"> Personal Portfolio Website </h4>
        <p> The results of this effort can be seen very clearly through this showcase. Much consideration went into doing this as it looks and even then, the design still leaves me
          with some uncertainty. Such as the section names, the navbar, the background, the content, etc. It's all uncertain and it's all to be revised. </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Built a responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript </li>
            <li> Added dynamic navigation features using Intersection Observer API </li>
            <li> Managed the project with Git for gradual development and version control </li>
          </ul>

        <h4 class="project-title"> Atlantic Center for Capital Representation (ACCR), Ruby and Ruby on Rails </h4>
        <p> This was a group effort between me and several other developing software engineers to prepare a website for ACCR for visitors and administrators alike. This project was
          my first introduction to working with on a software project while going through the official Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Constantly going back to the drawing
          board, the requirements of the stakeholders meant that going straight to the software without the proper planning wasn't an option. Meetings were virtual and in-person
          with a mentor to help guide us through the process. </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Simplified technical concepts and effectively communicated updates to stakeholders </li>
            <li> Utilized Ruby on Rails in conjunction with an MVC framework to maintain structure and performance </li>
            <li> Implemented user interface improvements based on user experience and feedback </li>
            <li> Tracked iterations and kept maintainability for future development teams </li>
          </ul>

        <h4 class="project-title"> Pong, Java </h4>
        <p>  </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Created a Pong game in Java using Swing for a responsive GUI, enhancing user experience </li>
          <li> Implemented core game mechanics including collision detection, keyboard controls, and scoring </li>
          <li> Object-oriented programming used for modularity, improving maintainability and future scalability </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="project-title"> Palindrome Checker, Clojure </h4>
        <p> This is something I am very proud about, extremely so. As an assignment my team and I were given, we were to learn Clojure from scratch and teach it to the rest of the class.
            Also, we were to create two assignments to go along with the teaching lesson. Task A and Task B. As my first introduction to functional programming, this made for a very
            interesting learning curve. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Before introducing assignment, introduced class of Computer Scientists to Clojure through powerpoints and programming examples </li>
          <li> Read in text file through multiple thread for concurrent processing </li>
        </ul>
